# ML-Placement-Predictor
## Project Overview
This is a Machine Learning Placement Predictor built using Logistic Regression in a Jupyter Notebook. The model is designed to predict whether a student will get placed based on their academic performance and other relevant factors.
<br>
## Dataset
The dataset consists of 1,000 students with features such as CGPA, IQ, and placement status.
The data has been cleaned and preprocessed to ensure accuracy.
<br>
## Model & Accuracy
The model is implemented using Logistic Regression, a supervised learning algorithm used for binary classification.
It achieves an accuracy of 100%, meaning it perfectly classifies the placement status of students based on the given data.

## Technologies Used
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas & NumPy (for data handling)
Scikit-learn (for building the model)
